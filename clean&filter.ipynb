Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.\\n【1】【2】【3】\\nPhotos\\nNaval fleet steams in East China Sea\\nNewborn golden snub-nosed monkey makes debut\\nIn pics: birds across China\\nGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase income\\nRelated Stories\\nExhibition highlighting art-science integration opens in BeijingChina’s AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019China’s leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence\\nAbout People's Daily Online |  Join Us | Contact Us\\nCopyright © 2021 People's Daily Online.

According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed space-themed video games with the robotic virtually day by day.\\nAs Kiwi was once fitted with machine-learning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly.\\nThe authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92 % had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary.\\nCameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84 % on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90 % accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute.\\nLead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on. \\n“Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting.”\\n“This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for real-time recognition and response to disengagement in order to re-engage the child to continue with the educational and/or therapeutic activity,” he stated.\\nFrom left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with co-authors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Matarić’s interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic.\\nHaotian mai\\nAround one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction (ASD), can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots.\\nCo-author Maja Matarić Maja J Matarić, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek:\\n“We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR [socially assistive robotics] for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and non-threatening.”\\nJain stated: “Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and real-world settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI [human-robot interaction] capacity in the past unexplored within the context of long-term, in-home SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD.\\n“Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to long-term in-home knowledge with youngsters with ASD. “\\nAsked why the kids’s engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matarić stated: “The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts.”\\nHowever, youngsters with autism do not want robots to harvest the advantages noticed within the learn about, Matarić stated.\\n“The maximum healing results come from being concerned human interactions,” Matarić explained. “Parents, siblings, caregivers and buddies can successfully inspire and make stronger studying and remedy of kids with ASD by way of paying cautious consideration to what youngsters to find rewarding and encouraging, and specializing in the ones interactions, shaping towards the kid’s particular wishes.”\\nShare This To World:TweetWhatsApp \\n\\n← Vogue fashion, 21, whose mysterious half-naked 4am balcony fall shattered bones all over her body finally takes first step\\nExclusive: Levi’s introduces paid family leave for workers →\\n\\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n \\nLast Minute New Orleans Hotel and Flight Package Offers\\n\\n\\n February 21, 2020February 21, 2020\\nadmin\\n0\\n\\n \\nAccused Marie Yovanovitch ‘Stalker’ Robert Hyde Now Supplying Documents to Congress\\n\\n\\n February 12, 2020February 12, 2020\\nadmin\\n0\\n\\n \\nWho Won the Tenth Democratic Debate in South Carolina?

Most businesses are playing catch-up trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what was coming up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the buzzwords coming up on PowerPoint slides from the different companies presenting: decommissioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 2030-35. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current income streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change has come and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn huge competition from up and coming brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbines – for being efficient and cheaper to run – and choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just one company. Machine learning (ML), AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CME – chief mechanical engineer – who, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanically-biased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when it comes to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video: www.dataweek.co.za/*mar21-abi Many decision-makers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tag #RepairDontWaste on LinkedIn in times like this, resulting in comments like, \"We did not anticipate that the equipment would become obsolete so quickly!\" or, \"Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted seven-figure prices to upgrade our assembly line.\"By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher; there is a widespread component shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decision-making when it comes to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to ‘fake news’ and myths such as:• A repaired electronic card (PCB/PCBA) will never be as good as a new one.• The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card.• Troubleshooting down to the component level is impossible or would take too long.• Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for in-house fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results and compromising the operation – from GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600+ plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired in-house. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being decommissioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed ‘irreparable’ by the OEM. In the rail arena, companies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several top-shelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs. The series gives an in-depth review of the key tests and techniques available in the British-made BoardMaster hardware and software platform from ABI Electronics to handle predictive as well as corrective maintenance of critical electronics without wasting time or money.

sign for electronic toll collection (ETC) newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.\\n【1】【2】【3】\\nPhotos\\nNaval fleet steams in East China Sea\\nNewborn golden snub-nosed monkey makes debut\\nIn pics: birds across China\\nGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase income\\nRelated Stories\\nExhibition highlighting art-science integration opens in BeijingChina’s AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019China’s leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence\\nAbout People's Daily Online |  Join Us | Contact Us\\nCopyright © 2021 People's Daily Online.

According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed space-themed video games with the robotic virtually day by day.\\nAs Kiwi was once fitted with machine-learning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly.\\nThe authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92 % had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary.\\nCameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84 % on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90 % accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute.\\nLead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on. \\n“Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting.”\\n“This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for real-time recognition and response to disengagement in order to re-engage the child to continue with the educational and/or therapeutic activity,” he stated.\\nFrom left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with co-authors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Matarić’s interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic.\\nHaotian mai\\nAround one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction (ASD), can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots.\\nCo-author Maja Matarić Maja J Matarić, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek:\\n“We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR [socially assistive robotics] for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and non-threatening.”\\nJain stated: “Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and real-world settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI [human-robot interaction] capacity in the past unexplored within the context of long-term, in-home SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD.\\n“Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to long-term in-home knowledge with youngsters with ASD. “\\nAsked why the kids’s engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matarić stated: “The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse.

Most businesses are playing catch-up trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what was coming up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the buzzwords coming up on PowerPoint slides from the different companies presenting: decommissioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 2030-35. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current income streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change has come and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn huge competition from up and coming brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbines – for being efficient and cheaper to run – and choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just one company. Machine learning (ML), AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CME – chief mechanical engineer – who, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanically-biased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when it comes to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video: www.dataweek.co.za/*mar21-abi Many decision-makers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tag #RepairDontWaste on LinkedIn in times like this, resulting in comments like, \"We did not anticipate that the equipment would become obsolete so quickly!\" or, \"Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted seven-figure prices to upgrade our assembly line.\"By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher; there is a widespread component shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decision-making when it comes to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to ‘fake news’ and myths such as:• A repaired electronic card (PCB/PCBA) will never be as good as a new one.• The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card.• Troubleshooting down to the component level is impossible or would take too long.• Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for in-house fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results and compromising the operation – from GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600+ plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired in-house. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being decommissioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed ‘irreparable’ by the OEM. In the rail arena, companies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several top-shelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs. The series gives an in-depth review of the key tests and techniques available in the British-made BoardMaster hardware and software platform from ABI Electronics to handle predictive as well as corrective maintenance of critical electronics without wasting time or money.

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.\\n【1】【2】【3】\\nPhotos\\nNaval fleet steams in East China Sea\\nNewborn golden snub-nosed monkey makes debut\\nIn pics: birds across China\\nGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase income\\nRelated Stories\\nExhibition highlighting art-science integration opens in BeijingChina’s AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019China’s leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence\\nAbout People's Daily Online |  Join Us | Contact Us\\nCopyright © 2021 People's Daily Online.

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.\\n【1】【2】【3】\\nPhotos\\nNaval fleet steams in East China Sea\\nNewborn golden snub-nosed monkey makes debut\\nIn pics: birds across China\\nGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase income\\nRelated Stories\\nExhibition highlighting art-science integration opens in BeijingChina’s AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019China’s leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence\\nAbout People's Daily Online |  Join Us | Contact Us\\nCopyright © 2021 People's Daily Online.

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July , . Peoples Daily Online/Li Wenming Thanks to the application of an artificial intelligence AI -empowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion. As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding percent. With the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away. This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing. Since the summer of , roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said. The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider. The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT . Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much. Such problems dont exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles. Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes results to transport authorities. The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes. For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said. Once the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system. Besides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft. So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.

The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes. For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said. Once the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system. Besides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft. So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.
